## Objectives:
- Start a packet capture on an ethernet port and save it to file.
- Use a display filter to detect HTTPS packets.
- Practice Task: Start a Wireshark capture and detect HTTP packets.
- Visit a web page and detect its IP address using a display filter.
- Locate all HTTPS packets from a capture not containing a certain IP address.
- Use Wireshark to capture and observe ethernet packets on HTTP and HTTPS ports.


## Key Takeaways
By completing the Wireshark packet capture project, I gained valuable insights into network traffic analysis and packet inspection. I learned how to capture live data packets, filter relevant information, and interpret key protocols such as TCP, UDP, and HTTP. This experience enhanced my ability to identify network anomalies, detect potential security threats, and troubleshoot performance issues. Additionally, I developed a deeper understanding of how data is transmitted and received across a network, and the importance of securing sensitive information from unauthorized access. Overall, the project strengthened my practical skills in network security and analysis.
